# BEAVRS

The BEAVRS benchmark (Benchmark for Evaluation And Validation of Reactor Simulations)
represents a 4-loop Westinghouse plant with a detailed description of fuel
assemblies, burnable absorbers, in-core fission detectors, core loading and
re-loading patterns. This benchmark enables analysts to develop extremely
detailed reactor core models that can be used for testing and validation of
coupled neutron transport, thermal-hydraulics, and fuel isotopic depletion.
The benchmark also provides measured reactor data and assocaited uncertainties
for Hot Zero Power (HZP) physics tests, boron letdown curves, and
three-dimensional in-core flux maps from 58 instrumented assemblies.

This repository contains the latest release of BEAVRS, including:

 - documentation: pdf and latex source files for the specifications and UQ report
 - measurement data: detector signals, power history, boron letdown, etc
 - models: inputs of simulation codes (e.g., OpenMC) for BEAVRS
